Webapp for educators for increased student engagement.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndrasGardos/Vocactive/master/demo.gif)

It's very important that educators keep all students engaged during the class. This app can manage groups of students, and help the teacher call them in random order - making sure that everyone can participate in the class. Usable on smartphones, tablets, laptops, smartboards.

Created using React and MaterialUI. The data of the groups are saved locally, they never leave the device.

Offline (PWA) capabilities coming soon :)
